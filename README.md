**🔬 Scanpy + Muon for Multi-Omics**

Scanpy 🧬 is a Python toolkit for single-cell analysis, and **Muon** ✨ extends it to handle multiple modalities (RNA, protein, ATAC, etc.) in a single framework.  
It’s conceptually similar to **Seurat + Signac** in R 🖥️, allowing integrated analysis, visualization 📊, and interpretation of complex multi-omics datasets in a streamlined workflow 🚀.
